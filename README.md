Resume Generator
================

This is the set of generation scripts and custom templates I use to build [my
resume][]. The actual yaml data files I use are not public (because they contain
personal information that's only available in a private print version).

Features
--------

-   HTML and LaTeX (print) output targets
-   Tiny code-base
-   Easy to write your own templates

To-Do
-----

-   Port build system from ReST to [Pandoc][], and allow the user to specify any
    input format they want
-   General code cleanup
-   Build with [Docco][] for some sexy literate programming magic
-   Make some example data files for public distribution with the repository
